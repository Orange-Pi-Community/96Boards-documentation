# Out of the Box

The following subsections describe how to get started with the Ultra96 using the release build shipped with your board. The MicroSD card provided in the kit is blank. Download the [MicroSD card image](http://avnet.me/ultra96-v2-oob). An easy way to copy the linux image to the MicroSD card uses [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

## Starting the board for the first time

The Ultra96 comes with a blank MicroSD card that must be loaded with linux before it can be used. Download the [MicroSD card image](http://avnet.me/ultra96-v2-oob). An easy way to copy the linux image to the MicroSD card uses [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

After loading the linux image on the card, it can be up and running in two ways:

> NOTE: In both cases ensure the included microSD card is fully inserted in the microSD card cage.

- **Option 1**
   - Connect the power supply to the Ultra96, the green LED D17 will illuminate.
   - Momentarily press the button labeled SW4 / POWER.  It is located between the two USB 3.0 Type A ports, the green power on LED D2 will illuminate.
   - The first sign that the boot process has begun will be an blue LED labeled D1 / DONE illuminating.  This means that the bistream for the FPGA portion of Ultra96v2 has successfully loaded.  This happens during uboot.
   - Once LED D7 begins to show a regular "heartbeat" Linux is up and running.
   - From a laptop or other device search for and connect to the WI-FI network called Ultra96_xxxxxxxxxxxx, where the 12 x's correspond to Ultra96's MAC ID.
   - From a browser, go to http://192.168.2.1
   - You will be greeted by Ultra96v2's homepage.

- **Option 2**
   - Connect the Ultra96v2 to a DisplayPort monitor with a miniDP to DisplayPort cable plugged into the connector labeled DISPLAY PORT.
   - Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to J8 and J9, or through a USB hub connected to J8 or J9.
   - Connect the power supply to the Ultra96.
   - Momentarily press the button labeled SW4 / POWER.  It is located between the two USB 3.0 Type A ports.
   - You will be able to watch the progress of the boot process on the monitor.
   - As in Option 1, an LED labeled D1 / DONE will illuminate at some point during boot.  This means that the bistream for the FPGA portion of Ultra96 has successfully loaded.
   - Linux will boot, launching a desktop environment.
